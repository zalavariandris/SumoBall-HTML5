# SumoBall-HTML5

The goal is to push down your opponent from the platform as many time as you can.

I wrote this game when I was a kid in DarkBasic. Since the original was lost a long time ago, and I always wanted to rewrite it, I decided to make it in javascript this time. It was such a fun to play with friends, and see others playing with this game. Back then I used a simple custom physics engine. I choosed cannon.js this time, so it could be extended to more complex environments. It use to have the option for more players, that is missing now, but might implement it later.

## Todo
 - more players
 - color selector
 - online multiplayer?

## Controlls
for now there's only two players.

the first player can be rolled with the __arrow keys__, and jump with __space__

the second is moved by __WASD__, and jump with __Q__
